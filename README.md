# ABCDHypergraphGenerator.jl

Artificial Benchmark for Hypergraphs Community Detection (ABCDH) - A Random Hypergraph Model with Community Structure

Bogumił Kamiński, Paweł Prałat, François Théberge

### Usage

The project is prepared to be run from command line interface.

Installation instructions:
* install Julia and make sure it is in search path
* clone the project repository
* change directory to `/utils` and run `abcdh.jl` file stored there following
  the example instructions given below.

Here is an example session output (assuming you are in `/utils` folder).

```
$ julia --project abcdh.jl --help
julia --project abcdh.jl -n N -d D -c C -x X -q Q -w W -s S [-o O] [-m] [-h] [--stats]

optional arguments:
  -o O        prefix for output file names; the generated file names
              are [prefix]_deg.txt for degree sequence,
              [prefix]_comm.txt for community size sequence,
              [prefix]_assign.txt for assignment of vertices to
              communities, [prefix]_he.txt for hyperedges
  -m          if this flag passed a multi-hypergraph is generated; by
              default a simple hypergraph is generated
  --stats     if this flag passed print generated hypergraph
              statistics
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

required arguments:
  -n N        number of vertices
  -d D        either a tuple γ,δ,D or file with degree sequence
              (filename cannot contain two commas)
  -c C        either a tuple β,s,S or file with community size
              sequence (filename cannot contain two commas)
  -x X        mixing parameter ξ
  -q Q        either a sequence q₁,q₂,...,qₖ of weights of hyperedges
              of sizes from 1 to k or a file name with such a sequence
              in the same format (if a single number is passed it is
              considered to be a filename)
  -w W        either one of values: ':strict', ':linear', ':majority' or a
              file name with weights for w_cd where in i-th line are
              comma separated weights for hyperedge of size i+2
              ranging from floor(i+2,2)+1 to i; the :strict value
              assumes that only c=d weight is non zero, the :linear
              value assumes weight equal to c, the :majority value
              assumes all weights are 1
  -s S        seed value for generator

The session shows you:
1. How to get help.
2. Generating standard hypergraph.
3. Generating a small "tight" hypergraph (that has significant number of initial collisions).
4. Generating a small "tight" non-simple hypergraph (collisions are accepted).

For steps 3 and 4 results are not saved to disk.

Note that statstics generation with `--stats` option can be time consuming for large hypergraphs.
